Karthika Manoharan
I done with my Citi interview today panel :balasubramanyan
1.write pair of sum from given integers whoâ€™s first and last is same and if more than 2 number there pick highest 2
2.how to write into file from specific point
3. Can we call run method directly
4.why we need executor framework
5.different between bean & component
6.what is another way of creating singleton
7.why should we go for no sql database



Ans-2
public class WriteAtPosition {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            String filePath = "example.txt";
            String textToWrite = " Inserted Text ";
            long position = 5; // Position to insert text

            try (RandomAccessFile file = new RandomAccessFile(filePath, "rw")) {
                // Move the file pointer to the desired position
                file.seek(position);

                // Write the text
                file.write(textToWrite.getBytes());

                System.out.println("Text written at position " + position);

            } catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }

Ans 4- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-java-executor-framework/

Ans 5 - In Spring, @Bean and @Component are both used to define beans, but they differ in how they are used and when they're applicable. @Component is a class-level annotation that marks a class for Spring to automatically detect and register it as a bean during component scanning. In contrast, @Bean is a method-level annotation used within a configuration class to explicitly declare a Spring bean, providing more control over bean instantiation and configuration. 

6- Already noted

7- NoSQL databases are favored when dealing with unstructured or semi-structured data, large datasets, and applications requiring high scalability and performance. Their flexibility, ease of use, and rapid development capabilities make them suitable for modern agile development practices and applications with dynamic data models.
